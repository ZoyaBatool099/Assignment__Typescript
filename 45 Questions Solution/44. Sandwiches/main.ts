// Write a function that accepts a array of items a person wants on a sandwich. The function should have one parameter that collects as many items as the function call provides, and it should print a summary of the sandwich that is being ordered. Call the function three times, using a different number of arguments each time.
function make_sandwich(...items: string [] ) {
    console.log(`Making a sandwich with: ${items.join(', ')}.`);
}
make_sandwich("turkey")
make_sandwich("ham", "cheese")
make_sandwich("roast beef", "chicken", "avocado", "bacon", "lettuce")
